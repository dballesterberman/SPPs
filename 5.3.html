<h2>5.3<br>Continuity Conditions</h2>
<blockquote><p>
At the surfaces of metal conductors, charge densities accumulate that
are only a few atomic distances thick.  In describing their fields,
the details of the distribution within this thin layer are often not of
interest.  Thus, the charge is represented by a surface charge density
(1.3.11) and the surface supporting the charge treated as a
surface of discontinuity.

</p><p>
</p><p>
In such cases, it is often convenient to divide a volume in which
the field is to be determined into regions separated by the surfaces
of discontinuity, and to use piece-wise continuous functions to
represent the fields.  Continuity conditions are then needed to
connect field solutions in two regions separated by the discontinuity.
These conditions are implied by the differential equations that apply
throughout the region.  They assure that the fields are consistent
with the basic laws, even in passing through the discontinuity.

</p><p>
</p><p>
Each of the four Maxwell's equations implies a continuity condition.
Because of the singular nature of the source distribution, these laws
are used in integral form to relate the fields to either side of the
surface of discontinuity.  With the vector <i><b>n</b></i> defined as the unit
normal to the 
surface of discontinuity and pointing from region (b) to region (a),
the continuity conditions were summarized in Table 1.8.3.

</p><p>
</p><p>
In the EQS approximation, the laws of primary interest are
Faraday's law without the magnetic induction and Gauss' law, the first
two equations of Chap. 4.  Thus, the corresponding EQS continuity
conditions are

<p>
Because the magnetic induction makes no contribution to Faraday's
continuity condition in any case, these conditions are the same as for
the general electrodynamic laws. As a reminder, the contour enclosing
the integration surface over which Faraday's law was integrated (Sec. 
1.6) to obtain (1) is shown in Fig. 5.3.1a.  The integration volume
used to obtain (2) from Gauss' law (Sec. 1.3) is similarly shown in
Fig. 5.3.1b.

What are the continuity conditions on the electric potential?
The potential <i><img src="5.3_files/Phi.gif"></i> is continuous across a surface of discontinuity
even if that surface carries a surface charge density.  This will be
the case when the <i><b>E</b></i> field is finite (a dipole layer containing an
infinite field causes a jump of potential), because then the line
integral of the electric field from one side of the surface to the
other side is zero, the path-length being infinitely small.

<p>

</p><p>
To determine the jump condition representing Gauss' law through
the surface of discontinuity, it was integrated (Sec. 1.3) over the
volume shown intersecting the surface in Fig. 5.3.1b. The resulting
continuity condition, (2), is written in terms of the potential by
recognizing that in the EQS approximation, <i><b>E</b> = - <img src="5.3_files/nabla.gif"> <img src="5.3_files/Phi.gif"></i>.

</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
<i> At a surface of discontinuity that carries a surface charge density,
the normal derivative of the potential is discontinuous</i>.

</p><p>
</p><p>
The continuity conditions become boundary conditions if they are
made to represent physical constraints that go beyond those already
implied by the laws that prevail in the volume.  A familiar example is
one where the surface is that of an electrode constrained in its
potential. Then the continuity condition (3) requires that the
potential in the volume adjacent to the electrode be the given
potential of the electrode. This statement cannot be justified without
invoking information about the physical nature of the electrode (that
it is "infinitely conducting," for example) that is not represented
in the volume laws and hence is not intrinsic to the continuity
conditions.
