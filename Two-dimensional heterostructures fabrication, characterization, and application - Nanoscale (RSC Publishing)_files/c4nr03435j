These 2D layers can be integrated into a monolayer (lateral 2D heterostructure) or a multilayer stack (vertical 2D heterostructure). The resulting artificial 2D structures provide access to new properties and applications beyond their component 2D atomic crystals and hence, they are emerging as a new exciting field of research. In this article, we review recent progress on the fabrication, characterization, and applications of various 2D heterostructures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":22771140,"mean":10.189825414817617,"rank":20243777,"pct":1,"higher_than":0},"journal":{"count":9207,"mean":4.229481481481488,"rank":7013,"pct":1,"higher_than":0},"similar_age_3m":{"count":231143,"mean":9.173881761506625,"rank":194301,"pct":1,"higher_than":0},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":38,"mean":4.1975263157894735,"rank":33,"pct":1,"higher_than":0}},"authors":["Hong Wang","Fucai Liu","Wei Fu","Zheyu Fang","Wu Zhou","Zheng Liu"],"type":"article","handles":[],"epubdate":1407888000,"altmetric_id":2902858,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":1,"last_updated":1416372006,"score":0.25,"history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4nr03435j","added_on":1416401463,"published_on":1407888000,"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"readers":{"citeulike":"0","mendeley":"467","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":467,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=ffffffff","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=ffffffff","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=ffffffff"},"details_url":"https://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2902858"})
